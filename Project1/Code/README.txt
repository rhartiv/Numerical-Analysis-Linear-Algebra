These are the codes for my project.
	My code consists of 6 functions:
		Jacobi.m
		GaussSeidel.m
		SOR.m
		SteepestDescent.m
		ConjugateGradient.m
		DiagonallyDominant.m
	As well as 3 scripts:
		Section1_1.m
		Section1_2.m
		Section1_2_d.m
To evaluate my two assigned matrices:
	matrix4.txt
	matrix14.txt
	
I recommend, after reviewing each of the functions, running the two scripts.
